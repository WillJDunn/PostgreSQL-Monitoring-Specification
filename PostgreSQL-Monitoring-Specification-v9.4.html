<h1>PostgreSQL Monitoring Specification v9.4</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document provides a specification for the monitoring that should be implemented for a PostgreSQL 9.4 instance. The preferred monitoring tool of the PostgreSQL community is Bucardo's Check Postgres, but this specification provides a basis for implementation in another framework. It includes SQL queries and bash commands that should be implemented, as well as detailed explanations of how the parameters should be set and what actions should be taken when the parameter passes the threshold.</p>

  <h2>Layout of this Document</h2>
    <p>Important note: the results listed in "SQL Example Results" were not taken at the same time so they will not match up. This is the case even between the 'base' and 'Dashboard
' versions of the same monitor</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <ul><li>Commentary provided describing the monitor.</li></ul>

    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul><li>Recommended thresholds for warning and critical statuses.</li></ul>

    <h3>Alert Response</h3>
      <ul><li>Suggested action that the DBA should take when that monitor triggers a warning.</li></ul>

    <h3>bash Command</h3>
      <ul><li>If the monitor uses a bash command - the command used is described here.</li></ul>

    <h3>SQL Scope</h3>
      <ul><li>If the monitor uses SQL - whether the query provides the details for all the databases in the cluster, or must be run for each database.</li></ul>

    <h3>Base Query</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If the monitor uses SQL - the SQL query that the monitor is based on. See the 'Dashboard
 Query' section for details on the differences.</li>
        <li>I kept this copy of the base query separate from the query used by Dashboard
 so it can later extended to specific monitoring tools which may have fewer limitations listed in the Dashboard Query section.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>SQL</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If the monitor uses SQL - the SQL query used by the Base Query.</li>
          <li>Note this may be cluster wide OR may need be executed on each database, as specified in the 'SQL Scope'.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>SQL Example Results</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If the monitor uses SQL - example results of the SQL query used by the monitor.</li>
          <li>Note that the query results were not collected at the same time nor under the same conditions so they may not be consistent.</li>
          <li>There may be multiple 'SQL Example Results' sections for a query to show what results will look like </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>SQL Example Results Pretty</h4>
        <ul><li>For queries with many rows we executed the same query as 'SQL Example Results' except the results are the 'expanded table formatting mode' to make it easier to read (psql '\x' command).</li></ul>

    <h3>Dashboard Query</h3>
      <ul><li>This is based on the Base Query but for a typical Dashboard application. The base query has been modified to support the limited fields monitoring applications typically have:</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Combine multiple fields into a single 'Comments' field to be used as the body of a ticket or email alert which monitoring applications typically make.</li>
          <li>The fields used by percentages in the base query were multiplied by 100 so they are a fraction of 100 rather than a fraction of 1.</li>
            <ul><li>For example, 90.2% will be displayed as .902 in the base query, 90.02 in the Dashboard
 query.</li></ul>
        </ul>

      <h4>SQL</h4>
        <ul><li>The Base Query with the modifications made for Dashboard
 described above.</li></ul>

 Query was executed.</li></ul>

<h1>Autovacuum</h1>

  <h2>perc_over_autovacuum_freeze_max_age/perc_until_autovacuum_freeze_max_age/perc_until_xid_wraparound</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>PostgreSQL's MVCC transaction semantics depend on being able to compare transaction ID (XID) numbers: a row version with an insertion XID greater than the current transaction's XID is "in the future" and should not be visible to the current transaction. Normal XIDs are compared using modulo-2^32 arithmetic, which means that ~2^32/2-1 transactions appear in the future and ~2^32/2-1 transactions appear in the past. To prevent XID wraparound the PostgreSQL Autovacuum worker will add a marker to the XIDs of old transactions which mark them as "frozen" and cause them to always be evaluated as older than any running transaction.</p>

      <p>This behavior of autovacuum is primarily dependent on the settings autovacuum_freeze_table_age and autovacuum_freeze_max_age, which are set as database defaults but can also be specified on a per table basis (as storage parameters in CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE)</p>
      <ul>
          <li>When a table's oldest transaction reaches autovacuum_freeze_table_age, the next autovacuum that is performed on that table will be a vacuum freeze</li>
            <ul><li>PostgreSQL implicitly caps autovacuum_freeze_table_age at 0.95*autovacuum_freeze_max_age.</li></ul>
          <li>When a table reaches autovacuum_freeze_max_age PostgreSQL will force an autovacuum freeze on that table, even if the table would not otherwise be autovacuumed or autovacuum is disabled.</li>
            <ul><li>PostgreSQL implicitly caps autovacuum_freeze_max_age at 2 billion (2000000000)</li></ul>
      </ul>

      <p>The actual age that a wraparound occurs is ((2^32)/2)-1. When a PostgreSQL database comes within 1 million of this age (2^32/2-1-1000000) the database will go into the safety shutdown mode" and no longer accept commands, including the vacuum commands, and your only recovery option is to stop the server and use a single-user backend (where shutdown mode is not enforced) to execute VACUUM. This should, obviously, be avoided at all costs.</p>

    <h3>perc_over_autovacuum_freeze_max_age</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As described above, when a table reaches autovacuum_freeze_max_age PostgreSQL will force an autovacuum freeze on that table, even if the table would not otherwise be autovacuumed or autovacuum is disabled. For each table we divide the age of the oldest transaction / the autovacuum_freeze_max_age. This number should never exceed 1 (100%) (or exceed it by much) because when 1 is reached (age of the oldest transaction = the autovacuum_freeze_max_age) an autovacuum freeze operation should be forced on this table. If this value far exceeds 1 something is wrong with autovacuum or there is something preventing the vacuum freeze operation from completing. Monitoring and addressing this is critical to ensure that transaction wraparound is being prevented by the "transaction id freeze' operation.</p>
        <p>Note that in our measurement of autovacuum_freeze_max_age we cap it at 2 billion (because PostgreSQL implicitly caps it at that value) so the value reported by the monitor may be different (2 billion) than that listed in the config of the config lists a value greater than 2 billion.</p>

    <h3>perc_until_autovacuum_freeze_max_age_10kRows</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As described above, when a table reaches autovacuum_freeze_max_age PostgreSQL will force an autovacuum freeze on that table, even if the table would not otherwise be autovacuumed or autovacuum is disabled. This operation acts on the table's entire visibility map so for very large tables (tables with more than 10,000 rows) this can use a lot of system resources and may impact performance, especially during peak load. For each large table (more than 10,000 rows) we divide the age of the oldest transaction / the autovacuum_freeze_max_age, and for tables smaller than 10,000 rows we return 0. Note that the number of rows is important, not the amount of data, because the visibility map size contains only high level row information such as ID and XID. Monitoring and addressing this is allows the DBA to manually perform a vacuum freeze operation on the table(s) during a slow period to prevent it from occurring during peak load.</p>
        <p>Note that in our measurement of autovacuum_freeze_max_age we cap it at 2 billion (because PostgreSQL implicitly caps it at that value) so the value reported by the monitor may be different (2 billion) than that listed in the config of the config lists a value greater than 2 billion.</p>

    <h3>perc_until_wraparound_server_freeze</h3>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As described above, the actual age that a wraparound occurs is ((2^32)/2)-1.

For each table we divide the age of the oldest transaction / (2^32/2-1-1000000). This should never occur because once autovacuum_freeze_max_age is reached a vacuum freeze should be triggered automatically (even if the table would not otherwise be autovacuumed or autovacuum is disabled) but we monitor this anyway because preventing a wraparound freeze is so critical.</p>

  <h2>user_table_bloat</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The PostgreSQL autovacuum demon performs several critical functions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It removes "dead" updated/deleted rows which are no longer needed for MVCC (and thus useless). Rows that are no longer needed for MVCC but remain in the table are referred to as "bloat"</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All the dead rows must be scanned during queries even though they are no longer needed, so removing them decreases the processing impact of having them remain there</li>
              <li>All dead rows remain on disk, so removing them allows disk space to be recovered or reused</li>
            </ul>
          <li>It updates data statistics used by the PostgreSQL query planner</li>
          <li>It updates the visibility map, which speeds up index-only scans</li>
          <li>It freezes old transaction ids to avoid transaction ID wraparound or multixact ID wraparound (as described and monitored by perc_over_autovacuum_freeze_max_age/perc_until_autovacuum_freeze_max_age/perc_until_xid_wraparound)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>To measure the performance of autovacuum to ensure that it is running and tuned to be aggressive enough we calculate the "bloat" for each table. If autovacuum is maintaining healthy levels of bloat it is safe to conclude that it is also maintaining statistics and the visibility map as well. To estimate table bloat for each table we divide the (live rows + dead rows)/(live rows)-1. Autovacuum will not vacuum a table until there are at least 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' dead rows as specified in postgresql.conf (the default is 50), so we put a threshold that the table must be at least autovacuum_vacuum_threshold*10 in size which will make us have no false positives above 0.1 (10%) bloat.</p>

  <h2>blocking_idle_in_transaction/idle_in_transaction</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>As of now sessions in PostgreSQL can be in one of the following five states (note that in PostgreSQL a "session"/"connection" is frequently referred to as a "backend"): </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>active: </b>the backend is executing a query</li>
          <li><b>idle: </b>the backend is waiting for a new client command</li>
          <li><b>idle in transaction: </b>the backend is in a transaction, but is not currently executing a query</li>
          <li><b>idle in transaction (aborted): </b>this state is similar to idle in transaction, except one of the statements in the transaction caused an error</li>
          <li><b>fastpath function call: </b>the backend is executing a fast-path function</li>
          <li><b>disabled: </b>this state is reported if track_activities is disabled in this backend</li>
            <ul><li>Note: this is not an actual state of a transaction. The transaction is actually in one of the other states but they are not being tracked by the view we are querying</li></ul>
        </ul>
      <p>Aside from using system resources sessions in most of these states do not cause any issue for PostgreSQL, but"idle in transaction" can cause potentially severe problems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The session that is idle in transaction can be holding a lock on a resource needed by another transaction, blocking the other transaction from running to completion</li>
            <ul><li>This acts very similar to a deadlock, but the system does not automatically resolve the issue (deadlocks automatically rollback and restart)</li></ul>
          <li>In MVCC, rows are not considered "dead" and eligiable to be vacuumed until there is no transaction older than it. So a transaction that has started but left idle prevents all deleted or old versions of updated rows to be retained until that transaction ends. This can cause a considerable amount of bloat in the database which leads to potentially serious performance problems</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The only way to resolve these issues is for the transaction that is idle to be resumed by the user, committed/rolledback by the user, or forcefully rolled back by a superuser</p>


    <h3>blocking_idle_in_transaction</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As described above, transactions that are in state 'idle in transaction' can hold a lock on a resource needed by another transaction, blocking the other transaction from running to completion. This acts very similar to a deadlock, but the system does not automatically resolve the issue (deadlocks automatically rollback and restart). The only way to resolve these issues is for the transaction that is idle to be resumed by the user, committed/rolledback by the user, or forcefully rolled back by a superuser. In this monitor we identify all the sessions that are in state "idle in transaction", measure how long each has been in state "idle in transaction", and how many other transactions each is blocking (0 if they are not blocking other transactions), and the maximum amount of time that it has been blocking another transaction. This gives us the ability to identify when this problem arises either ask the user to resume, commit, or rollback their transaction OR forcefull roll it back. Note that it is also possible for a automated cron job to be run periodically which identifies such transactions (via the below query) and forcefully rolls them back.</p>

      <h4>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Frequency: </b>as needed to support warning/critical logic</li>
          <li><b>Warning: </b>as specified by customer at onboarding, recommend blocking any transaction for longer than 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Note: Dashboard
 can only support using one parameter as a threshold, so use either the amount of time it has been blocking another transaction (which will be 0 if no transaction is blocked) rather than some combination of time idle in transaction and number of transactions blocked. We could theoretically use a combination of the number of transactions that are being blocked and modify the the frequency of the check, but usually we would want to make sure no transactions are being blocked so being warned if any transaction is blocked</li>
          <li><b>Critical: </b>as specified by customer at onboarding</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Alert Response</h4>
        <p><b>Warning</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>As specified by customer at onboarding either notify customer, kill the transaction, or notify customer asking if transaction should be killed</li>
            <ul><li>You can force a rollback by executing 'SELECT pg_cancel_backend(holding_pid);'. pg_terminate_backend() will disconnect the user.</li></ul>
          </ul>
        <p><b>Critical</b></p>

    <h3>idle_in_transaction</h3>
      
      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As described above, transactions that are in state "idle in transaction" cause problems for MVCC - rows are not considered "dead" and eligiable to be vacuumed until there is no transaction older than it, so a transaction that has started but left idle prevents all deleted or old versions of updated rows to be retained until that transaction ends. This can cause a considerable amount of bloat in the database which leads to potentially serious performance problems. In this monitor we identify all the sessions that are in state "idle in transaction" and report on how long each has been idle.</p>

      <h4>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Frequency: </b>as needed to support warning/critical logic, but not higher than 10 minutes. EnterpriseDB's PEM (PostgreSQL Enterprise Monitor) checks this every minute</li>
          <li><b>Warning: </b>as specified by customer at onboarding, recommend 30 minutes</li>
          <li><b>Critical: </b>as specified by customer at onboarding</li>

  <h2>connections_databases</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Each PostgreSQL database has a connection limit that can be specified. The default, and most common value, is unlimited (value = -1). However, a limit can be set on each database using the ALTER DATABASE command. Once the number of connections to a database has reached its limit PostgreSQL will throw an error to any new connection attempts to that database. We divide the current number of connections to each database / that databases' connection limit. When the connection limit is reached this value will be 1 (100%). When the limit is being reached a superuser can perform an "ALTER DATABASE name WITH CONNECTION LIMIT connlimit" to increase the connection limit, and can make connections unlimited by setting it to -1. A superuser can also use pg_terminate_backend() to force idle users to disconnect.</p>

    <h3>Alert Response</h3>
      <p><b>Warning</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Confirm that database level connection limits are necessary and perform an "ALTER DATABASE name WITH CONNECTION LIMIT connlimit" to increase it to an appropriately value or set it to unlimited(setting -1 removes the limit). See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/sql-alterdatabase.html</li>
          <li>Notify customer and ask if this is expected</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If not, ask if the app can be restarted and see if some clear up</li>
              <li>If so, re-evaluate why there is a database level connection limit and increase</li>
                  <ul><li>If they are approaching 350 'active' connections on the <i>server</i> consider implementing a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer)</li></ul>

  <h2>connections_server</h2>
    <p>TODO: provide SQL to force backends in state 'idle' to disconnect</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Each PostgreSQL server has a connection limit set in the config file ("max_connections" parameter). Once the number of connections to a server has reached this limit PostgreSQL will throw an error to any new connection attempts. We divide the current number of connections to the server / the server's connection limit (max_connections). When the connection limit is reached this value will be 1 (100%). In this case a superuser can use pg_terminate_backend(pid) to force connections that are in state "idle" to disconnect (note "idle in transaction" connections should not be terminated), may modify the max_connections parameter (requires restart), or suggest a connection pooler. Note that there is also a per-database limit that is tracked separately (see connections_databases).</p>

  <h2>outage</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>To ensure the database is up and users are able to connect we connect and execute a simple 'SELECT 1;' or 'SELECT now();' query. EBD consultant Douglas Hunley recommends 'SELECT now();' because you will not receive a cached value if you are using a fancy pooler or sharding application that caches values. However, 'SELECT now();' has more overhead than 'SELECT 1;' so if we know we will connect directly or through PgBouncer 'SELECT 1;' may be preferred</p>

  <h2>xlog_readyfiles_age</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When WAL (write ahead log) archiving is enabled, PostgreSQL uses the bash command listed next to "archive_command" in the config to copy each finished xlog to the archive destination. PostgreSQL tracks this process as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When a WAL log is finished (full) PostgreSQL creates a file in the directory '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/' with the name of the WAL file and file extension .ready</li>
            <ul><li>For example, if WAL log 'abc123' filled up PostgreSQL would create a file named '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/abc123.ready'</li></ul>
          <li>PostgreSQL executes the archive_command on that finished WAL log to copy it to the archive destination</li>
          <li>If the archive_command succeeded PostgreSQL will rename the .ready file it created in '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/' with the name of the WAL file and the extension.done</li>
            <ul><li>For example, if WAL log 'abc123' filled up PostgreSQL would have created a file named '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/abc123.ready'. Once the archive_command completes (and the file is succesfully copied to the archive destination) the file '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/abc123.ready' is renamed to '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/abc123.done'</li></ul>
          <li>The .done file that was created will eventually be deleted</li>
        </ol>
        <ul><li>However: if the archive_command fails the file will not be archived and the .ready file created in '$PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/' will remain and will not be renamed or deleted until the archive command succeeds (and the finished WAL is copied to the archive destination)</li></ul>
       <p>The successful completion of the archive_command is critical for recovery. If the archive_command is failing the completed WAL logs may not be available should the database's filesystem fail. Luckily the above process makes it very easy to monitor failure of archive command and ensure WAL logs are being logged within your Recovery Point Objective. We check the age in seconds of the oldest .ready file in $PGDATA/pg_xlog/archive_status/ and make sure there is no .ready file older than our recovery point objective.</p>


    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frequency: </b>every 10 minutes</li>

<pre>
The following bash command will return the number of seconds old the oldest .ready file is. If there is no .ready file it will return 0. We cannot divide the seconds by 60 to get minutes in bash because bash cannot do floating point arithmetic

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The pg_stat_replication view displays an entry for each connected hot standby. If a hot standby goes down or becomes disconnected there will not be any entry for that standby. The pg_stat_replication view will also have an entry for each pg_basebackup that is running, but those will have a value in the 'state' field = 'backup' so we can exclude them easily. For this monitor we get the count of values returned by "SELECT from pg_stat_replication WHERE state NOT IN ('backup','startup')" which should return the count of hot standbys that this server should be connected to. If one standby server goes down or becomes disconnected the value returned will decrease by one.</p>

<h1>Hot Standby Information Only</h1>

  <h2>hot_standby_send_delay/hot_standby_replay_delay</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Execute this SQL against the master to get a status of the replicas. If the replicas are not connected they will not have an entry. This is not the same as the hot_standby_delay check in check_Postgres.pl. check_Postgres.pl requires connecting to both the master and the slave.</p>

    <p>The function pg_xlog_location_diff is used to compare the pg_lsn of 'pg_current_xlog_location' of master to the pg_lsn of the standby's write_location to determine the 'send_delay' of the standby. pg_xlog_location_diff is also used to compare the pg_lsn of the standby's write_location to the pg_lsn of the standby's replay_location to determine the 'replay_delay' of the standby. The returned value is the difference in bytes.<br>
    Requires pg_stat_replication view and therefore requires 9.2 and above. The documentation for 9.1 shows that it has this view as well but does not provide any details about the view so we do not know what it contains.</p>

    <p>The state of the standby is more complicated to determine - if the standby is not connected the query will not return any result for that standby.</p>

    <h3>Differences from check_Postgres.pl Version</h3>
    <p>The Bucardo tool check_Postgres.pl has a similar check with the same name, but rather than using the pg_stat_replication view it requires you connect to the slave as well, collect it's pg_current_xlog_location(), and compute the difference from the master.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>When data from a table, index, or other object is read into the buffer cache data from other tables/objects must be evicted from the cache to make space. Poorly written SQL which is less selective than it should be and queries that have to use sequential scans because they do not have indexes that are needed can cause a large amount of uneccesary data to be read into the buffer cache, evicting more useful data and decreasing performance. We use the pg_buffercache view provided by the pg_buffercache contrib module to track how much of shared buffers each table is occupying. If a table has periodic spikes where more buffer cache is being allocated to it the queries against that table may be candidate for performance tuning.</p>
      <p>When the pg_buffercache view is accessed, internal buffer manager locks are taken for long enough to copy all the buffer state data that the view will display. This ensures that the view produces a consistent set of results, while not blocking normal buffer activity longer than necessary. Nonetheless there could be some impact on database performance if this view is read often.</p>
      <p>We wrote two versions of this query:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Version 1: </b>only objects that currently have data in the buffercache are listed. This is more efficient for obvious reasons</li>
          <li><b>Version 2: </b>all objects in the database are listed regardless of whether they have data in the buffercache. This is less efficient, but it results in there being an entry for every table with 0 buffers listed rather than no entry at all. Some monitors require this when creating graphs, and Dashboard
 requires this if you are alerting (the object would need an entry with a value below the threshold for the alert to be turned off).</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b>Note: </b>this monitor requires the pg_buffercache contrib module be installed and added as an EXTENSION in each database. Use the command: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_buffercache;</p>


    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frequency: </b>TBD. There is some impact on database performance if this view is read often.</li>
        <li><b>Warning: </b>none</li>

    <h3>Base Query - VERSION 1</h3>
      <p>There are two versions of this query. This version (version 1) lists only those tables that have data in the buffercache, and is more efficient. The other version (version 2) lists all objects in the database regardless of if they have data in the buffercache and display a buffer count of 0 for tables with no data in cache.</p>

  <h2>connections_count_by_state</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This monitor provides the number of connections that each database has in each state (active/idle/idle in transaction/etc.). This is mostly useful because it helps us to determine if a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) should be implemented and helps us determine what a reasonable value of max_connections should be.</p>


    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frequency: </b>every 30 minutes. 1 hour may be appropriate. 15 minutes may be appropriate</li>
        <li><b>Warning: </b>none</li>
        <li><b>Critical: </b>none</li>
      </ul>


    <h3>Alert Response</h3>
      <p><b>Health Check</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If 'active' connections count during peak hours is above 350 consider implementing a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer)
</li>
          <li>If there is a large number of 'idle' connections relative to active connections consider implementing a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) so you can tune max_connections to a lower value</li>
          <li>If there are frequently connections in state 'idle in transaction' complain to the application developers per the concerns listed in monitor 'idle_in_transaction'</li>
          <li>View trends and discuss with the client to tune max_connections to a reasonable value given the trend in connections and expectations for the future</li>

  <h2>database_stats (includes database_size/cache_hit_ratio/commit_ratio)</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>From pg_stat_database for each database we list the database size, the settings that determine what statistics are tracked (settings: track_activities, track_counts, and track_io_timing), the number of rollbacks, commits, divide commits by (commits + rollbacks) to get the commit ratio, divide the blocks hit in buffer cache by (blocks hit + blocks read from disk) to get the cache hit ratio, add the count of rows returned + count inserted + count updated + count deleted to get "row activity", list of rows returned by SELECT queries, ratio of rows returned by select queries to "row activity", count inserted rows, ratio of rows inserted to "row activity", count updated rows, ratio of rows updated to "row activity", count deleted rows, ratio of rows deleted to "row activity", add the time spend reading blocks to the time writing blocks to get "blk read write time", time spend reading blocks, ratio of time spend reading blocks to "blk read write time", time spent writing blocks, ratio of time spent writing blocks to "blk read write time", number of temp files, total size of temp files, number of deadlocks there have been, and when these stats were last reset</p>
      <p><b>Issue:</b> the information in this pg_stat_database view is not preserved in major version upgrades. You can find when these were last reset via the 'stats_reset' field.</p>

    <h3>cache_hit_ratio</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The performance of an OLTP database is highly dependent on the working data set being contained in the buffer cache (RAM). To measure the percentage of the working data set that is (usually) contained in the buffer cache we divide the number of blocks read from buffer cache/(blocks read from disk + blocks read from buffers). For a healthy database we try to tune this value as close to .9 (90%) as possible. To increase the amount of working set that is contained in the buffer cache the DBA can increase the size of shared_buffers, can add indexes to prevent queries from doing full page scans (which evict other data from buffers to make space for the table scan), and the application developers can tune their queries to be more selective (for the same reason).</p>
        <p>Note that this is for OLTP only: OLAP databases typically have more random access patterns which are unlikely to be in the buffer cache. For these we already increase shared_buffers to be extremely high because we know in advance that the read/write ratio will be highly skewed to read. It would be helpful to make sure we have indexes set up where needed but we are monitoring that separately via index_hit_ratio</p>


      <h4>Alert Response</h4>
        <p><b>Health Check</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tune as close to .9 (90%) as possible</li>
            <li>Ensure that shared_buffers is set right and increase as needed</li>
              <ul>
                <li>We normally cap shared_buffers at 8gb, but that "rule" is only true for high write workloads. We limit this to avoid potential write storms at checkpoint time so</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The more your read/write ratio skews to read, the more you can go over 8gb</li>
                  <li>If your I/O is extremely fast you can go over it too</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Inspect the buffers and see what it contains and confirm you are not frequently evicting data from the buffers because a query does a full table scan</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Add indexes or improve/tune the queries as needed</li>
                  <ul><li>The index_hit_ratio may help</li></ul>

    <h3>database_size</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>We track database size for reports. To some extent covered by 'pgdata_directory_size' and 'tablespace_directory_size'. For each database we collect the database size in bytes (pg_database_size). This will allow us to project future database growth and ensure there is enough hardware resources to support it.</p>

  <h2>disk_io</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Monitor the disk-write load. This is a standard monitor that is included by default for every monitoring tool. We just use whatever is standard for for the monitoring tool. We need this value so we can tune the size of shared_buffers and checkpoints to avoid stressing I/O during checkpoints.</p>


    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frequency: </b>every 10 minutes</li>
        <li><b>Warning: </b>none</li>
        <li><b>Critical: </b>none</li>
      </ul>


    <h3>Alert Response</h3>
      <p><b>Health Check</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tune the buffer cache size and checkpointing settings to get the best possible I/O utilization and avoid stressing it</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>bash Command</h3>
      <p>Whatever is standard for the monitoring tool.</p>



  <h2>index_hit_ratio</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>We track the percentage of queries that are scanning indexes vs performing sequential scans so we can ensure indexes are set up where needed. Index use by queries is critical for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sorting of index values allows very CPU efficient lookups</li>
        <li>Using indexes allows the database to limit the amount of data that must be read from disk</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This greatly improves query performance because retreiving data from disk is very slow</li>
            <li>This reduces the load on disk resources which allows those resources to be used by other queries</li>
            <li>This reduces the amount of data that must be evicted from the buffer cache to make room for data read from disk</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>We calculate this value by dividing the count of index scans/(the count of sequential scans + the count of index scans) of tables larger 5.12kb. Tables smaller than 5.12kb are excluded because for very small tables the optimizer may prefer sequential scan even if there is an index. To increase the number of queries using indexes the DBA can  rebuild indexes and update stats to increase the likelyhood that the optimizer will use it, and investigate query changes with customer and see if other indexes may be needed</p>


    <h3>Default Frequency/Thresholds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Frequency: </b>once a day</li>
        <li><b>Warning: </b>none</li>
        <li><b>Critical: </b>none</li>
      </ul>


    <h3>Alert Response</h3>
      <p><b>Health Check</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For OLTP databases tune as close to .95 (95%) as possible. For OLAP databases tune as high as possible but expect a lower value.</li>
            <ul>

  <h2>index_pages_row_ratio</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>B-tree index pages that have become completely empty are reclaimed by vacuum for re-use. However, if all but a few index keys on a page have been deleted, the page remains allocated. Therefore, a usage pattern in which most, but not all, keys in each range are eventually deleted will see poor use of space. For such usage patterns, periodic reindexing is recommended. In this monitor we track, for each index, the number of pages the index is using divided by the number of rows the index has (the number of rows in the </p>

  <h2>table_stats (includes table_pages_row_ratio)</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Track the size of each table and activity performed on each table for reports. We take various values from pg_stat_user_tables of n_tup_ins (the number of rows inserted), n_tup_upd (the number of rows updated), n_tup_del  (the number of rows deleted), autoanalyze_count (the number of times the table was autoanalyzed to update optimizer statistics). We also use the pg_relation_size and pg_size_pretty system administration functions to get the size of each table.</p>
      <p><b>Issue:</b> the information in this pg_stat_user_tables view is not preserved in major version upgrades. You can find when these were last reset via the 'stats_reset' field of the 'database_stats' monitor.</p>
      <p>Another useful statistic tracked is 'table_pages_row_ratio' which is the number of pages the table is using divided by the number of (live) rows. It tracks the kind of bloat that normal vacuum cannot handle: normal vacuum can shrink the table only if the trailing page(s) are empty – it just truncates the table file by how many empty pages are at the very end. If you get this kind of bloat you must either do vacuum full (which locks the index) or pg_repack (which requires double the size of the table in available space) or manually move the tuples and vacuum as described in Depesz blog post (http://www.depesz.com/2013/06/21/bloat-removal-by-tuples-moving/)</p>

<h1>PgBouncer</h1>


  <s><h2>connections_pgbouncer</h2></s>
      <p>Not implemented</p>
        <ul><li>Incomplete, requires programming</li></ul>
<s>
    <p>Getting information from PgBouncer on its connections and pools are available by connecting to PgBouncer via psql (psql -p PGBOUNCERPORT -d pgbouncer) and querying PgBouncer system views. However, there is not any actual SQL query engine so ordinary SQL commands cannot be used. So, you can have PgBouncer display the entire contents of its view tables but you cannot manipulate them within the application. External scripting is required (perl, etc.)</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>To ensure PgBouncer is up and users are able to connect we connect via PgBouncer's port and execute a simple 'SELECT 1;'. There is not much we can do with PgBouncer: we can restart it and modify the max_client_conn setting but not much else.</p>

For example, if you have 2 instances of PgBouncer running on the machine you would set critical warning to 1 (which is 2-1). In most cases only 1 PgBouncer instance is running on a machine so this value should usually be 0.</li>
